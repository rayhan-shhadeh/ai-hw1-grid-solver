# Grid Solver #
Welcome to Grid Solver! This tool helps you navigate through a square grid filled with obstacles from a starting cell to a target cell using JavaScript.
The A* Search Algorithm is utilized for efficient pathfinding.

## Features ##
Grid-Map Generator: Generate a square grid with obstacles.
Path Solver: Find the shortest path from a starting cell to a target cell.
Customization:
Define grid size by specifying width and height.
Place the starting cell, target cell, and blocked cells.
Option to add up to two target cells, with the algorithm choosing the nearest.
Choose between Manhattan distance and Euclidean distance as the heuristic function.
Visualization: Display the number of steps required to reach the target and the number of tested nodes.
Usage
## Grid Building: ##

Input the width and height to construct the grid.
Specify the locations of the starting cell, target cell(s), and blocked cells.
Pathfinding:
Common text
Choose the heuristic function for pathfinding.







Initiate the solver to find the shortest path from the starting cell to the target cell.
